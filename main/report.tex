    \begin{abstract}
        Blockchain is a crypto finance house that scaled up fivefold in
        employees in less than a couple of years.
        This article looks into the challenges it faced scaling up human and
        technical resources (mostly drawing from personal experience) and reflects
        on what worked well and what did not.
    \end{abstract}

    \section{Blockchain's Size, Business Model and Stack}\label{sec:business}

    I have worked at Blockchain for little under 2 years and during that time I was able to observe
    how the company went from about 110 employees to more than 500 at the time of writing (with many
    of the new joiners being engineers), transformed into a remote-first organisation~(largely because
    of the coronavirus), grew an institutional business, and tripled its existing retail business.

    The company started in 2011 as a free simple blockchain explorer~\cite{bcAbout} that later
    begun offering non-custodial online Bitcoin wallets.
    When I joined, it had around 40 million active wallets in several cryptocurrencies,
    a brokerage service (to buy and sell crypto to users), as well as a recent currency
    exchange (where users trade with each other, not unlike Coinbase~\cite{coinbasePro}).

    This is implemented with a microservices architecture, with some services
    being much larger than others.
