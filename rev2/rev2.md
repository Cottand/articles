# Peer Review for _When do you think adopting a microservice architecture is (or is not) a good idea?_

The article meets the required formatting guidelines and is factually correct

The article sometimes makes empty statements. For example, _"organizations that are well suited [...] to
use microservices"_ does not specify what exactly makes an organization well-suited to
use microservices, which is the core of the discussion.

I knew about gateways as a pattern for microservice architectures, but not
about Uber's particular case and the name of their methodology, _DOMA_.
That was interesting!

The case study is also well-referenced and so it is easy to verify it is
also factually correct.

While the article does try to discuss the trade-off of microservices,
I believe it could have benefited from a use case with both benefits
and the price that was paid for them, rather than a good and a bad case studies.

It is great that the article did not just mention Istio, but also gave the specific reasons of why
microservices were not a good fit for the company.

Otherwise it would have been very interesting _why_ microservices worked
for Netflix and not Uber - what were they doing differently?

Unfortunately, the article only slightly covered the broader business contexts of the case studies listed:
how are Uber, Netflix and Istio different? (other than the fact that Istio does not need to scale up quickly)
